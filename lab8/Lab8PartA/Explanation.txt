The Hibernate Session is closed as soon as the entity is fetched when the @Transaction
is not used. Hibernate is unable to fetch them because the Session is no longer available.
This results in a LazyInitializationException.

 Using transaction ensures that the entity and all its associated entities are fetched
 within the context of a single Hibernate Session, which remains open until the end of the
 transaction. This allows Hibernate to fetch the associated entities when needed and prevents
 the LazyInitializationException.
