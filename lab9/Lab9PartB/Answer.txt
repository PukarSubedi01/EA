Benefit of transaction demarcation in the class level:

After adding @Transactional annotation to the AccountService class all the
methods of the class will be accumulated in a single transaction.
Due to this, eager fetch of the account entries from account can be replaced with lazy fetch.
And, while fetching the account and the account entries, both of them will be done in a single
transaction which will ultimately fetch the account and associated account entries collectively.
